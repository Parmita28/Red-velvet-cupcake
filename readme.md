This is my cupcake recipe, I am going to make red-velvet-cupcakes for the masterchef junior competition, by the way I am V.S.Parmita and I am a coder from WhitehatJr and I have participated in this competition to show that coders are also great cooks and can make delicious dishes. I love to cook food and bake cakes, cupcakes are smaller than cakes but tastier. I am sure this recipe is going to be useful for everyone and don't forget to add all the ingredients of the correct amount.
